Is this the sort of art they're supposed to like? Is it hanging in a famous museum, or reproduced in a big, expensive book?

And even then you'd still see some disagreement. People do vary, and judging art is hard, especially recent art.

That took me years to figure out. The educational system in most countries trains you to win by [hacking the test](lesson.html) instead of actually doing whatever it's supposed to measure.

    "5": "Writing is considered a stricter test than talking for several reasons. Firstly, writing requires a commitment to a specific sequence of words, which forces the writer to clarify their thoughts and structure their ideas in a coherent manner. Unlike conversation, where tone and body language can help convey meaning and where ideas can be expressed more loosely, writing demands precision and completeness. \n\nAdditionally, the process of revising and reading back what you've written adds another layer of rigor. Writers must evaluate their work from the perspective of a neutral reader who cannot access the writer's internal thought process. This means the writer has to ensure that their writing stands alone and makes sense without any additional context. This level of scrutiny often leads to the realization that more information or clarification is needed, prompting multiple revisions and a thorough examination of the content.\n\nIn summary, while both writing and talking can be used to express ideas, writing requires a higher level of precision, commitment, and critical assessment, making it a stricter test of one's ability to effectively communicate.",

The proof lies in the notion of aesthetic judgement and the ability to differentiate between varying levels of artistic quality. When we investigate the differences between artworks liked by different individuals or generations, we can see that certain artworks hold enduring value, while others may fade in significance over time. This inconsistency in appreciation suggests that there is an underlying standard of quality that defines good taste. Additionally, when individuals engage in creative practices, such as painting, and subsequently compare their work to that of recognized masters like Bellini, they come to realize the existence of a qualitative force guiding artistic merit. Thus, despite the subjective claims of taste, the comparative analysis reveals that good taste is indeed a tangible and assessable reality.",

Prior to this, YC treated its partners as a pool, where startups were assigned to the next available partner for office hours, leading to confusion and dissatisfaction among the partners when the number of startups exceeded 60. The restructuring into smaller groups helped to ensure that partners could develop a stronger understanding of and relationship with the startups they were advising.",

If founders themselves wouldn't use the product they've created, it's a strong indication that potential users will feel the same way, which severely hampers acquisition efforts.\n\nAdditionally, founders often misjudge the relative importance of various problems they face. They might spend time worrying about less critical issues while overlooking significant threats to their business, such as product quality or market readiness. This misalignment can lead to a misunderstanding of where to focus their efforts for effective user acquisition.\n\nFurthermore, the inherently new and counterintuitive nature of startups complicates the situation. Since they are typically venturing into uncharted territory, founders may lack the experience and knowledge necessary for effective user acquisition strategies. Combined with an educational background that often emphasizes testing strategies rather than practical problem-solving, many founders may struggle to adapt to the demands of running a startup.\n\nIn summary, a lack of product quality, misprioritization of problems, and inadequate preparation for the unique challenges of startups can all contribute to founders' difficulties in acquiring users.",
    "14": "Based on the provided context, past virtue does not affect legal guilt. The text states that even if someone has lived a virtuous life, committing a crime means they must still face the legal consequences. While past virtue might mitigate the punishment, it does not change the fact of their guilt. In legal terms, guilt is determined by actions, not by one's previous character or behavior.",
    "15": "Yes, good taste is required for recognizing good art. The text explains that if good art exists, it can be distinguished by the ability to choose better art based on one's taste. Those with better taste will consistently select art that is regarded as better when comparing choices. In the context of art appreciation, good taste involves making aesthetic judgments that reflect the quality of the art rather than being influenced by external factors. Thus, recognizing good art hinges on one's ability to discern and appreciate it, which is fundamentally related to having good taste.",
    "16": "Yes, desires can be intentionally altered, but it is a complex and rare process. One can change what they want to want, but doing so is not very common, especially as the hierarchy of desires increases. The text suggests that while it's theoretically possible to modify our deeper desires (what we want to want to want, and so forth), it becomes increasingly difficult and abstract to actually achieve these changes. In practice, most people find it challenging to shift their desires beyond a few levels deep.",
    "17": "Heretics historically faced the punishment of death, often by burning, for expressing opinions that were deemed contrary to established religious beliefs. This punishment reflected a time when publicly doubting fundamental tenets, such as the divinity of Christ, could lead to severe consequences, regardless of an individual's overall goodness or contributions to society. In contemporary times, while the physical punishment has diminished in civilized countries, those deemed heretics may still face significant repercussions, such as losing their jobs or social standing, illustrating that the societal response to heresy still holds strong.",
    "18": "The provided context suggests that while art and vaccines operate differently and elicit varied responses from individuals, there are some comparable aspects in terms of their impact on people. Both art and vaccines can be \"designed\" to affect people, and both can be assessed for their effectiveness, albeit in different ways. \n\nVaccines confer immunity based on biological responses, which can vary among individuals, but overall their effectiveness can be evaluated against medical standards. Similarly, art can evoke responses and influence individuals, though measuring its effectiveness is more complex due to subjective interpretations and the nuances of individual taste.\n\nThe context implies that while one can discuss the effectiveness of both vaccines and art, there is a greater challenge in establishing universal judgments in art due to its subjective nature. However, the notion that both can impact people in significant ways \u2013 that art can be \"good or bad\" based on how well it achieves its intended effect \u2013 provides a basis for comparison. \n\nIn conclusion, art's impact on people can be viewed as comparable to vaccines in that both can be effective in affecting individuals, but measuring and understanding that impact is much more complicated in the case of art.",

    "22": "The alteration of pre-Industrial Revolution human life was primarily driven by the development of agriculture, which transformed the way people lived and socialized. This change was characterized by broad, gradual improvements in agricultural techniques rather than the discoveries made by a few exceptional individuals. Additionally, while there was a significant growth in scholarship, leading to some individuals becoming exceptionally knowledgeable, this had limited practical effects on everyday customs and life. Wealth accumulation prior to the Industrial Revolution was often accomplished by capturing resources, akin to emperors, and did not significantly rely on scientific discovery or innovation.",

    "24": "To avoid intellectual dishonesty, one can:\n\n1. **Admit Mistakes**: Maintain a readiness to acknowledge when you are wrong. This creates a sense of freedom and reduces the burden of carrying false beliefs or assumptions.\n\n2. **Cultivate Intellectual Honesty**: Strive to be earnest in your pursuits and committed to truth. Recognize that honesty is not just a moral virtue but also a source of personal power and clarity in understanding new ideas.\n\n3. **Maintain a Skeptical Mindset**: Be willing to critically evaluate your own beliefs and ideas, constantly challenging them to ensure they align with reality.\n\n4. **Foster a Growth Mindset**: Embrace the idea that learning and growth come from recognizing and correcting your mistakes, rather than clinging to false notions out of pride.\n\nBy combining these approaches, individuals can enhance their capacity for intellectual honesty and improve their ability to perceive and adopt new ideas.",
    "25": "A major difference between school and work is that in school, you are typically presented with clearly defined problems that you learn to solve using the knowledge you've been taught, while in real life, you often have to identify the problems yourself, and many of them may not have known solutions. Additionally, school tends to equate productivity with conventional jobs, whereas in work, especially for creative individuals like writers or artists, productivity can encompass a broader range of activities that may not be tied to a specific job.",
    "26": "A \"winner take all\" scenario is characterized by a situation where a few top performers receive disproportionately high rewards compared to others, even if their performance is only slightly better. This type of scenario creates a step function relationship between performance and return; for example, in a sports match, the winning team receives the same win regardless of whether they excelled far beyond the other team or merely surpassed them by a small margin. In these scenarios, entering a field with a few major winners can be daunting, as it indicates that those few individuals or entities outperform the vast majority significantly. Consequently, fields with such dynamics tend to exhibit superlinear returns, where the potential for inequality in earnings or success is heightened.",
    "27": "Schools encourage passivity by establishing a structured environment where authority figures dictate the learning process. From a young age, students are directed on what to learn and assessed on their performance through classes and tests, which are not inherently linked to the act of learning itself. This top-down approach fosters a reliance on external guidance and can impair critical thinking and problem-solving skills. \n\nAdditionally, the educational system creates a false understanding of work by presenting problems as solvable within the framework of what has been taught. In contrast, real-life situations often require identifying and addressing problems independently, without clear solutions or guidance. This difference reinforces a passive mindset, where students may come to expect that answers will be provided rather than needing to seek them out actively.\n\nFinally, the notion presented by teachers that effort yields proportional results can lead to a misconception about competition and success. In reality, the relationship between input and outcome is often nonlinear and unpredictable, suggesting that merely putting in effort is insufficient; understanding the market and differentiating one's work are crucial for success. This further entrenches a passive mindset, as students may not learn to navigate the complexities of real-world challenges.",
    "28": "Original thinkers are driven to generate ideas by a combination of puzzlement and independent-mindedness. They have a habit of mind that compels them to throw off new ideas spontaneously when they focus on a topic. This process often begins when someone with expertise encounters something puzzling, leading to confusion that motivates them to seek solutions. Additionally, independent-mindedness allows original thinkers to approach problems from unique perspectives, which fosters the development of new ideas. While this quality may be largely inborn, it can also be cultivated, further enhancing their capacity for originality.",
    "29": "Art's impact on people can be compared to vaccines in that both can be designed to affect individuals in specific ways, and both can be considered effective or ineffective depending on various factors. Just as vaccines work to confer immunity\u2014albeit with varying success among individuals\u2014art can be created with the intention of influencing emotions, thoughts, or perceptions, though its reception may differ widely. \n\nHowever, the analogy is complicated by the qualitative nature of art, which cannot be evaluated as straightforwardly as the efficacy of vaccines can. The response to art is subjective and reliant on individual interpretation, experience, and knowledge, making universal assessments of its effectiveness more complex. While there is some level of agreement on the value and impact of certain works of art, it remains challenging to measure or define it with the same precision as one might with a medical intervention.\n\nIn summary, while art's impact and vaccines both seek to elicit responses in individuals, the criteria and measures of effectiveness differ significantly.",

    "41": "The act of writing significantly enhances the thought process and problem-solving capabilities, particularly when dealing with complicated and ill-defined problems. Writing helps in several key ways:\n\n1. **Clarification of Ideas**: Writing forces a person to articulate their thoughts more precisely. This process helps in transforming vague ideas into clearer, more organized concepts, allowing for better understanding and a more comprehensive grasp of the issue at hand.\n\n2. **Completeness**: When ideas are written down, they tend to become more complete. This often leads to a more thorough exploration of the topic, as writing can reveal gaps in knowledge or logic that weren't initially apparent.\n\n3. **Generating New Ideas**: Writing not only clarifies existing thoughts but can also stimulate the generation of new ideas. The challenge of articulating thoughts can create a \"vacuum\" that encourages further exploration and the emergence of previously unconsidered concepts.\n\n4. **Structured Problem-Solving**: For complex problems, writing offers a structured method for breaking down the problem into manageable parts. This structured approach can help individuals navigate through the complexities more effectively.\n\n5. **Disadvantage for Non-Writers**: As noted, individuals who do not engage in writing may find themselves at a disadvantage in solving complex problems because they may lack fully formed ideas or the ability to refine their thoughts through articulation.\n\nIn summary, writing is an essential tool that aids in the development of cogent, complete, and actionable ideas, which is especially crucial in tackling challenging problems.",

    "46": "Real-life work can differ significantly from school in terms of problem-solving in several ways. In school, problems are clearly defined and typically solvable with the knowledge and skills that have been directly taught. This structured environment can create a false sense of ease, as students are rarely faced with the ambiguity of identifying what problems exist or whether they can be solved at all. In contrast, real-life work often presents undefined problems where individuals must first discern what the issues are and then evaluate the feasibility of addressing them, which can lead to a more complex and unpredictable problem-solving experience.\n\nNegative examples can be particularly educational in this context because they highlight the challenges and uncertainties inherent in real-world situations. When individuals encounter failures or difficult scenarios, they are pushed to reflect on their decision-making processes and problem identification skills. These negative experiences can foster resilience and creativity, encouraging individuals to think more critically about which problems are worth solving and how to approach them. Additionally, such experiences can serve as a reminder that not all problems have clear solutions, promoting a deeper understanding of the complexities of work and the need for originality in problem selection.",
    "47": "According to both contexts provided, the recommended focus for achieving great work is to concentrate on developing and pursuing genuine interests rather than conforming to external expectations of importance or success.

This involves four key steps: \n\n1. **Choose a Field**: Select a discipline or area of study that excites you.\n2. **Learn Enough**: Acquire knowledge to reach the frontier of that field, understanding the latest developments and ideas.\n3. **Notice Gaps**: Pay attention to areas within the field that are underexplored or where questions remain unanswered.\n4. **Explore Promising Ones**: Investigate these gaps further to discover new opportunities for contribution.\n\nAdditionally, students should maintain a balance between deep, intentional work and creative thinking. Daydreaming and exploration should be interspersed with focused efforts that challenge and develop your understanding. This combination of curiosity and structured work will help students to maximize their learning and ultimately enable them to produce great work.",
    "49": "Lack of expertise can significantly contribute to originality when exploring knowledge gaps because it allows individuals to approach problems with a fresh perspective. When someone is not deeply entrenched in a particular field or set of assumptions, they may find themselves puzzled by concepts that those with more expertise take for granted. This state of puzzlement is a fertile ground for originality, as it encourages questioning and allows for the exploration of ideas that might otherwise be overlooked.\n\nThe confusion that arises from a lack of expertise can lead individuals to notice gaps in knowledge that more experienced professionals may ignore or dismiss. This is crucial because many breakthroughs occur when someone asks questions about the familiar or challenges the status quo. The willingness to embrace uncertainty and strangeness\u2014qualities that often accompany a novice perspective\u2014can spark innovative ideas and solutions that might not emerge in a more conventional approach.\n\nIn summary, a lack of expertise can serve as a catalyst for originality by fostering a mindset open to exploration and questioning, enabling individuals to tackle problems from unconventional angles and discover new insights.",
