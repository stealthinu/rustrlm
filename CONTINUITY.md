Goal (incl. success criteria):
- Decide and document the intended spec for a secure, deterministic, string-focused Python-REPL-compatible subset (Rust),
  by extracting expected REPL behavior from paper test data and comparing against official/unofficial implementations.
- Rewrite the non-official Recursive Language Models (RLM) runner in Rust, separating the REPL engine into a standalone library crate and the RLM orchestration into an independent crate/binary, and validate end-to-end with saved transcripts/evals.
 - Treat this repo as the Rust RLM project (end-to-end runnable), with the Python REPL subset as an internal, embedded library crate (no repo split).
 - Provide RustRLM as an HTTP JSON “retrieval layer” that can replace Retriever components in LangChain/LlamaIndex (and other agent SDKs) via thin adapters.

Constraints/Assumptions:
- Follow AGENTS.md instructions for this workspace.
- Use required skills (using-superpowers, brainstorming) before creative work.
- Write tests first for behavior changes (t_wada TDD).
- Maintain security guardrails (no file I/O, networking, subprocesses in interpreter).
- Python venv is not available (ensurepip missing); Python deps are installed under vendor/python and used via PYTHONPATH.
- Docs are written in Japanese (user preference).
- Secrets: API keys are stored locally in `.env` (gitignored); never commit secrets.

Key decisions:
- Docs language: Japanese.
- Baseline priority shifted: prefer running and extracting behavior from the non-official implementation + test data; treat `alexzhang13/rlm` as a reference point.
- Defer language-feature decisions (e.g. `re`) until behavior is confirmed by running the baseline(s).
- Import policy (Rust target): allow `import ...` / `from ... import ...` as a no-op that *only* binds from pre-injected, allowlisted modules/symbols; never perform dynamic importing.
- Import allowlist expansion strategy: (1) seed with the same “safe stdlib” modules the unofficial Python backend pre-injects, and (2) iteratively add only the specific symbols observed in transcripts/evals.
- RLM rewrite LLM client: OpenAI API fixed; read `OPENAI_API_KEY` from `.env`; use `gpt-5.2` (root) + `gpt-5-mini` (recursive).
- Repo strategy: keep a single monorepo/workspace; do not split into separate GitHub repos for REPL vs RLM.
- Product direction: position RustRLM as a “retrieval layer” alternative to RAG (broad sense). First integration target is retriever replacement in LangChain/LlamaIndex.
- Retrieval integration: expose a stable HTTP JSON Retrieval API + a small Python client; framework-specific adapters are thin type/shape conversions.

State:
- Upstream repos and benchmark datasets are cloned/downloaded locally; paper artifacts extracted into a runnable corpus.
- Next milestone: generate/obtain remaining eval artifacts (S-NIAH), then run a probe harness on real benchmark inputs to
  empirically capture what the baseline REPL allows/forbids (imports, builtins, comprehensions, slicing, regex, etc.).
- GitHub repo exists: `stealthinu/rustrlm` (public). `origin` configured; `main` pushed.
- Workspace split done: `python_string_repl` is a library crate under `crates/`; REPL CLI binary name `python_string_repl` preserved via `python_string_repl_cli`.
- Next milestone: implement Rust `rlm_runner` (OpenAI API fixed) with transcript logging and dataset runners.

Done:
- Read using-superpowers skill.
- Attempted to read CONTINUITY.md (was missing).
- Created initial docs and TODO scaffolding (TODO.md, docs/rlm/*).
- Cloned official repo `alexzhang13/rlm` at 6eb5f6be87eec214bd6b75b23f8dff60d9242f6c.
- Extracted initial REPL protocol notes from official tests/code.
- Downloaded arXiv HTML for 2512.24601v1 and extracted embedded listings + ```repl blocks into a local corpus.
- Cloned non-official repo `ysz/recursive-llm` at 2fb46cc59e64cddc0768ce0bf428138dab3016eb.
- Documented initial REPL behavior notes for the non-official implementation.
- Ran the non-official REPL executor on the paper-derived repl corpus and recorded results (import statements fail; `re` works without import).
- Ran the non-official repo tests; noted 1 failing integration test related to comprehension + slicing behavior.
- Downloaded benchmark paper PDFs and extracted candidate dataset source URLs.
- Identified dataset release sources on Hugging Face for key benchmarks (BrowseComp+, LongBench-v2, OOLONG variants).
- Downloaded several HF datasets locally (BrowseComp+ tasks/corpus, LongBench-v2, smaller OOLONG-synth variants).
- Cloned RULER repo for S-NIAH/NIAH task generation.
- Extracted OOLONG-Pairs task prompts embedded in the RLM paper (Appendix E.1).
- Generated a seeded S-NIAH-like dataset (50 tasks) into `extracted/eval/s_niah.jsonl`.
- Ran a probe harness over real benchmark inputs and recorded results in `extracted/runs/repl_probes.jsonl`.
- Expanded the probe set (for/if, f-strings, generator-expr+any, json.loads, re.split) and confirmed these pass; failures remain limited to `import` and listcomp expr-scope capture.
- Recorded Hugging Face dataset repo SHAs (pinning targets) in `docs/rlm/eval/dataset-sources.md`.
- Wrote probe results memo: `docs/rlm/eval/repl-probe-results.md`.
- Added repo hygiene files: `.gitignore` (ignore `.env`, `upstream/`, `extracted/`, `vendor/python/`), `.env.example`, `README.md`, `.editorconfig`.
- Generated `requirements-vendor.txt` to recreate `vendor/python` dependencies without committing vendored libs.
- Added local tools to validate OpenAI model access and run a budget-capped unofficial RLM evaluation:
  - `tools/check_openai_models.py`
  - `tools/run_unofficial_rlm_budgeted_eval.py`
  - `tools/load_dotenv_local.py`
- Verified OpenAI API access: `gpt-5.2` OK; `gpt-5.2-mini` unavailable (NotFound/no access); `gpt-5-mini` OK.
- Ran the 1/10-scale task-count eval (30 tasks) with unofficial baseline RLM:
  - root model: `gpt-5.2`, recursive model: `gpt-5-mini`
  - output: `extracted/runs/unofficial_tasks30.jsonl` (15 BrowseComp+, 5 CodeQA, 5 OOLONG-synth-small, 5 S-NIAH)
  - approximate cost (LiteLLM estimate, summed across run segments): ~$2.25 (UNCONFIRMED vs dashboard)
- Implemented REPL transcript logging and ran the same 30-task set with transcripts:
  - runner: `tools/run_unofficial_rlm_logged_eval.py`
  - results: `extracted/runs/unofficial_tasks30_logged.jsonl`
  - transcript: `extracted/runs/unofficial_tasks30_transcript.jsonl`
  - analysis: `tools/analyze_repl_transcript.py` -> `extracted/runs/unofficial_tasks30_repl_analysis.json`
  - docs: `docs/rlm/eval/unofficial-tasks30-repl-log.md`, `docs/rlm/eval/unofficial-tasks30-required-subset.md`
- Confirmed transcript logging works on a single-task smoke run:
  - `extracted/runs/log_smoke3_tasks.jsonl`
  - `extracted/runs/log_smoke3_transcript.jsonl`
  - Note: model often outputs `FINAL(var)` which is not parseable by the baseline parser, causing extra REPL iterations.
- Fixed transcript instrumentation to log FINAL parsing events by patching `rlm.core.parse_response` (core imports parser symbols by value):
  - verified with `extracted/runs/log_smoke4_transcript.jsonl` containing `final_parsed` events.
- Fixed a bug in `tools/run_unofficial_rlm_logged_eval.py` where `error` could remain set from a previous failed attempt even after a later retry succeeded (future runs only).
- Added rerun support to `tools/run_unofficial_rlm_logged_eval.py`:
  - `--only-import-errors-from-transcript` (re-exec just prior `__import__ not found` tasks)
  - `--inject-b64zlib` (inject base64/binascii + capped zlib + missing RestrictedPython guards for observation)
- Added transcript filtering helper: `tools/filter_transcript_by_tasks.py`.
- Reran only the import-failure tasks (9) with injected base64/binascii + capped zlib + guards:
  - results: `extracted/runs/unofficial_importfail_rerun_logged.jsonl` (9/9 ok)
  - transcript: `extracted/runs/unofficial_importfail_rerun_transcript.jsonl`
  - analysis: `extracted/runs/unofficial_importfail_rerun_repl_analysis.json`
  - baseline subset (same 9 tasks from old 30): `extracted/runs/unofficial_importfail_baseline_*`
  - diff: `extracted/runs/unofficial_importfail_repl_diff.json`
  - memo: `docs/rlm/eval/unofficial-importfail-rerun-summary.md`
  - note: REPL-level errors still occur (e.g. model writes `FINAL(...)` as code), but `__import__ not found` dropped sharply (baseline 18 -> rerun 1 in these 9 tasks).
- Created a Rust crate implementing a safe, deterministic, string-focused Python-REPL-like subset (CLI):
  - CLI entry: `src/main.rs` (JSON in/out)
  - engine: `src/repl/mod.rs` (+ `allowlist.rs`, `parse.rs`, `eval.rs`, `builtins.rs`, `value.rs`)
  - tests (system-level, 10 cases): `tests/system_repl.rs` (+ `tests/zlib_bomb_1100000_a.b64`)
  - design doc: `docs/plans/2026-01-25-rust-repl-implementation-design.md`
  - all tests pass: `CARGO_HOME=$PWD/.cargo-home cargo test`
  - lint: `CARGO_HOME=$PWD/.cargo-home cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
- Parity tooling + fixes (LLM-free):
  - Added transcript replay tool: `tools/replay_transcript_with_rust_cli.py`
  - Extended Rust subset to match the unofficial executor output/state semantics:
    - Output truncation marker matches upstream (`[Output truncated: ...]`)
    - Python-ish `re.Match` / list printing for parity
    - list slicing support
    - "No code to execute" for empty input
    - Echo last expression (e.g. `query`, `s`) to output
    - Preserve state even on execution errors
    - Emulate RestrictedPython `_print` leakage via internal `_print_txt` (and clear it when code contains `print(...)`)
  - Replay results:
    - `unofficial_importfail_rerun_transcript.jsonl` vs Rust: mismatches=0
    - `unofficial_tasks30_transcript.jsonl` vs Rust: mismatches=1 (expected; baseline transcript assumes no base64 injection)
  - Updated Python side adapter to apply Rust state even on errors: `upstream/recursive-llm/src/rlm/repl.py`
- End-to-end integration runs:
  - Fixed `tools/run_unofficial_rlm_logged_eval.py --inject-b64zlib` to work when `RLM_REPL_BACKEND=rust` (Rust executor has no `_build_globals`).
  - Ran smoke eval with Rust backend + strict-code to ensure REPL logs are clean (no prose-as-code / no import attempts):
    - `extracted/runs/rust_backend_smoke5_transcript.jsonl`
    - `extracted/runs/rust_backend_smoke5_repl_analysis.json`
  - Ran 30-task eval with Rust backend (same task-count mix as baseline): 
    - `extracted/runs/rust_backend_tasks30_transcript.jsonl`
    - `extracted/runs/rust_backend_tasks30_repl_analysis.json`
  - Ran 30-task eval with Python RestrictedPython backend + injection + strict-code to get a “base64/zlib available” baseline transcript:
    - `extracted/runs/unofficial_injected_tasks30_transcript.jsonl`
    - `extracted/runs/unofficial_injected_tasks30_repl_analysis.json`
  - Replay parity results (Rust CLI vs transcripts):
    - `unofficial_importfail_rerun_transcript.jsonl`: mismatches=0
    - `unofficial_tasks30_transcript.jsonl`: mismatches=1 (expected due to base64 injection differences)
    - `unofficial_injected_tasks30_transcript.jsonl`: mismatches=1 (one `print(context[:1000])` expected output differs; cause UNCONFIRMED)
  - Prompt hardening status:
    - Base prompt: `upstream/recursive-llm/src/rlm/prompts.py` (paper-style; allows prose/import unless patched)
    - Runner option `--strict-code` appends code-only/ASCII/no-import constraints (and `--inject-b64zlib` adds “base64/binascii/zlib are pre-provided” note).
	    - Observed errors in transcripts:
	      - `rust_backend_smoke5_transcript.jsonl`: parse=0, import=0
	      - `rust_backend_tasks30_transcript.jsonl`: parse=13, import-related=4 (needs further prompt tightening or input normalization if we want ~0)
	- Implemented permissive import handling in Rust REPL (no-op + allowlisted bindings) and added system tests:
	  - supports `import X`, `import X as Y`, `from X import y [as z]`, `import a, b, c`
	  - current allowlist bindings: `re` (`search`, `findall`, `IGNORECASE`, `DOTALL`), `base64` (`b64decode`), `binascii` (`hexlify`), `zlib` (`decompress`, `MAX_WBITS`)
	  - added `json` (`loads`) + dict/list indexing needed for `json.loads` outputs
	- Verified: `cargo test` + `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` pass (with `CARGO_HOME=$PWD/.cargo-home`).
	- Initialized git history: created first commit on branch `main`; ensured `.cargo-home/` is gitignored.
	- Published repo to GitHub: `stealthinu/rustrlm` (public), `origin` configured, `main` pushed.
	- Began Rust workspace split (crate separation) and added RLM runner design doc: `docs/plans/2026-01-25-rust-rlm-runner-design.md`.
	- Prepared a project-local Codex home at `/home/stealth/restrlm/.codex` by copying relevant `~/.codex` files and rewriting session `cwd` from `/home/stealth/python-string-repl` to `/home/stealth/restrlm` (sandbox prevents edits under `/home/stealth/.codex`).
	- Wrote Retrieval API spec (inline documents) and implemented HTTP server endpoints:
	  - Spec: `docs/rlm/plans/2026-01-26-rustrlm-retrieval-api-design.md`
	  - Server: `GET /v1/health`, `GET /v1/version`, `POST /v1/retrieve` (axum)
	  - Tests: `crates/rlm_runner/tests/retrieve_api_tests.rs` (TDD, green)

Now:
- Implement Rust RLM runner: CLI, transcript JSONL, OpenAI client, dataset loaders.
- Build Python client + LangChain/LlamaIndex retriever adapters on top of the Retrieval API.
- Write a detailed Retrieval API spec (HTTP endpoints, schemas, trace/logging, limits, error model) before implementation.
- Verify `/resume` shows prior sessions when launching Codex with `CODEX_HOME=/home/stealth/restrlm/.codex`.
- Make `/resume` work without `CODEX_HOME` override (prefer migrating real `~/.codex` data; fallback: auto-set `CODEX_HOME` via shell/direnv).

Next:
- If needed, run a one-time manual migration in the real home dir (`/home/stealth/.codex`) outside sandbox: back up `~/.codex/sessions` then rewrite `session_meta.payload.cwd` to the new path.
- (If needed) Add a switch/config to run Rust REPL with/without `base64`/`zlib` injected, to match either baseline transcripts or the “observability” configuration.
- Expand system tests with a handful of representative transcript-derived snippets and keep them stable as golden tests.
 - Add allowlisted bindings for newly seeded modules/symbols (TDD): start with `json.loads` and the minimal helpers that appear in logs.

Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
- Whether the user wants a one-time migration of `~/.codex` (so plain `codex` works everywhere) or prefers per-project `CODEX_HOME` auto-switching (direnv/shell function).
- Whether downloading the full official OOLONG releases (`oolongbench/*`, tens of GB) is feasible/necessary for this phase.
- How to pin exact dataset revisions for HF downloads (current local snapshots lack revision metadata; may require re-download).
- Whether the Rust subset should intentionally diverge from the non-official baseline on comprehension scoping (to match CPython semantics).
- Estimating end-to-end eval cost if the user provides an LLM API key and runs the non-official baseline against benchmark tasks (model/pricing dependent).
- Rough implementation timeline/effort for the Rust REPL subset (depends on exact protocol + allowlist choices).
- Whether to treat `FINAL("...")` parsing as purely syntactic (current baseline extracts even if embedded in non-executed branches) vs enforce an explicit REPL-side `FINAL` callable for correctness.
